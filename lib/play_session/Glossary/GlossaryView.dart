      description:
      "The maximum amount of CO2 (and other greenhouse gases, expressed as CO2e) an entity can emit over a period of time as a result of its carbon emissions reduction goals. Carbon budgets can be set by individuals, organizations (incl. companies) and countries.",

      title: "Carbon Dioxide (CO2):",
      description:
      """ A gas consisting of a carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. CO2 occurs naturally in the earth's atmosphere. Its concentration in the atmosphere has risen from 280 parts per million in pre-industrial times to 415 parts per million today. CO2 absorbs and radiates heat, and thereby helps to control the temperature on earth. However, if there is too much CO2 in the atmosphere, temperatures on earth increase.
        CO2 is emitted naturally through volcanoes and hot springs and by humans, principally through the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas). CO2 is absorbed by plants and trees. Therefore, deforestation also contributes to the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere. CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Other gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are more powerful in terms of absorbing heat, but they are less plentiful and stay remain in the atmosphere for a shorter period of time than CO2.

      description:
      """ 
      A standardized measure of greenhouse gas emissions expressed as equivalents of CO2. Each greenhouse gas has its own Global Warming Potential (see below). Expressing emissions as CO2e involves multiplying the quantity of emissions of a greenhouse gas by its Global Warming Potential. This enables emissions of different types to be compared or added up.

      description: "A declaration by the manufacturer about the environmental impact of a product. An EPD usually includes a full lifecycle assessment (LCA), including the environmental impact of manufacturing of the product, its use and its disposal after its useful life. An EPD contains a statement on the product's embodied carbon.",

      title: "Offset:",
      description: "An offset is a reduction in GHG emissions made as compensation for emissions elsewhere. Offsets can take the form of avoided emissions (e.g. by generating additional renewable energy) or carbon capture (e.g. by planting a forest). Offsets have been criticized, as they may seem to offer companies the opportunity to avoid reducing their own emissions.",

      description: "Agreed in 2015, the Paris Agreement provides a framework for countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to keep global rise in average temperatures well below 2 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement has been signed by over 190 countries, representing more than 95% of global greenhouse gas emissions.",

      title: "Scope 1, 2, 3:",
      description: "The GHG Protocol classifies emissions into Scope 1 (onsite emissions), Scope 2 (emissions from purchased energy) and Scope 3 (emissions in the wider value chain of an organization). Emissions that are part of Scopes 1 and 2 are easiest to track and influence by a company. However, emissions outside the immediate boundaries of an organization (e.g. embodied carbon of purchased products or emissions arising from the use of a company's product) can be even greater than Scope 1 and 2 emissions. In Net Zero, if the hotel outsources its laundry operations, Scope 2 emissions will fall and Scope 3 emissions (from purchased laundry services) will go up.",
